<h1 align="center">InventoryPro</h1>

> A full-stack inventory management and analytics platform with secure authentication, product operations, stock alerts, category insights, and a responsive SaaS-style workspace.

---

## 📖 Overview

InventoryPro gives small operations teams a focused workspace for maintaining a product catalog and understanding current stock health. Users can create an account, manage inventory, identify replenishment risks, search and filter the catalog, and view live analytics calculated from persisted PostgreSQL data.

The project pairs a responsive React frontend with a secured Spring Boot REST API. JWT authentication protects inventory data, BCrypt hashes credentials, BigDecimal preserves monetary precision, and integration tests exercise the main authenticated workflow.

The API is the source of truth for authentication, products, stock status, and analytics. The React client attaches the active JWT to protected requests and refreshes the relevant views after inventory changes.

## ⚙️ Local Installation

### Prerequisites

- Java 17
- Node.js 20 or newer
- Docker Desktop or PostgreSQL 14+
- Git

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SinghSampreet04/InventoryPro.git
cd InventoryPro
```

### Start PostgreSQL

With Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d database
```

This creates an `inventorydb` database on port `5433` using the local development credentials defined in `compose.yaml`. The non-default host port avoids conflicts with an existing PostgreSQL installation.

### Run the Backend

```bash
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Backend API:

```text
http://localhost:8085
```

The default configuration works with the included PostgreSQL container. For another environment, set:

```text
DATABASE_URL
DATABASE_USERNAME
DATABASE_PASSWORD
JWT_SECRET
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN
```

Use a strong, private `JWT_SECRET` outside local development.

### Run the Frontend

Open another terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Frontend:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

Vite proxies API calls to `http://localhost:8085` during development. Set `VITE_API_URL` when the API is hosted elsewhere.

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Authentication

```text
POST   /auth/register
POST   /auth/login
```

### Products

```text
GET    /api/products
POST   /api/products
PUT    /api/products/{id}
DELETE /api/products/{id}
GET    /api/products/low-stock
```

### Analytics

```text
GET    /analytics
GET    /analytics/categories
```

Product and analytics endpoints require:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run the backend integration suite:

```bash
cd backend
./mvnw test
```

Run frontend component tests and create a production bundle:

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
npm run build
```

The backend suite verifies protected endpoints, registration, JWT access, product creation, analytics calculations, low-stock detection, and deletion against an isolated H2 database.
